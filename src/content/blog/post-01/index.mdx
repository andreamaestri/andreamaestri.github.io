Clicking <button class="btn btn-xs btn-primary text-bold font-sans">**APPLY**</button> for the **Headforwards Digital Academy bootcamp**, I felt a mix of **nervousness, excitement,** and maybe just a **touch of fear**. Embarking on software development felt like a **giant leap**, but I knew I was ready for a **challenge** that could open up new paths. Now, **two months** in, I'm thrilled to share how transformative this experience has been so far!

### Why Software Development? Why Now?

After being **redundant** in **2023**, I found myself wanting more **stability, growth, and** ***‚Äîif I‚Äôm honest‚Äî*** **a bigger challenge.** Teaching myself coding was *challenging*; When I discovered the Headforwards bootcamp, it felt like the perfect opportunity to bridge my *creativity* with new *technical skills* in a supportive, structured way. Plus, the local tech scene is growing, and contributing to this community is **quite exciting!**

### Full-Stack from Day One üíª

***‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a full-stack developer from Day 1!‚Äù*** It was one of the initial things we heard when starting this course, and it‚Äôs true‚Äî*I already feel like one.* It‚Äôs structured to help us feel like **full-stack developers** from the start, ***building confidence through hands-on, real-world projects and exercises.***

***In these first few months***, I‚Äôve gone from the basics of **HTML** and **CSS** to more advanced topics like responsive design using **Bootstrap**, and **JavaScript**, now I just finished **Object Orientated Programming** and **Python**, and now it‚Äôs time to do some cloud-based PaaS back-end development with **Heroku** and **Django**. We‚Äôre encouraged to see the ***big picture, stay up to date, learn independently*** and ***think about how these different layers interact***, which makes every project feel **meaningful**.

### First Capstone Project: Mental Health in Tech üå±

<div class="flex flex-wrap gap-2">
    {["HTML", "CSS", "Bootstrap", "GSAP", "Responsive Design"].map((tech) => (
        <div class="badge badge-outline">{tech}</div>
    ))}
</div>
One of my favourite projects so far has been creating a **website** focused on mental health awareness for developers. I built a responsive site that included **JavaScript**-based breathing animation exercises to encourage mindfulness. I even experimented with the **GSAP** animation library, which pushed me out of my comfort zone but showed me how powerful **animations** can enhance **user experience**.

        **Look at the deployed project!**
    </a>
</div>
This project combined two passions: my interest in **mental health** and my desire to make **meaningful**, polished digital experiences. Working with these technologies after a month of learning felt ***challenging*** but incredibly ***rewarding***, and I saw how my skills could be applied in **real-world ways** to address **important issues**.

### Building Technical Confidence with Community Support ü§ù

Before starting the bootcamp, I was intimidated by **JavaScript** and didn‚Äôt feel confident about creating **full-fledged applications**. But with the structured approach here, I‚Äôve gone from basic scripting to building fully working websites and using frameworks like **TailwindCSS** and **Astro** (in my own time). Every day brings new **technical skills**, and the hands-on projects make it clear that **I‚Äôm not just learning;** ***I‚Äôm creating.***

Community support has been equally essential. Even though the program is remote, I‚Äôve built close connections with both the **CodeInstitute** team and coursemates. There‚Äôs a strong emphasis on a growth mindset, and everyone‚Äôs encouraged to share knowledge and help each other with a **SaaS** *agile work* environment, we do **daily standups/stand-downs** and **reviews**. This **support system** has kept me motivated, especially on challenging days, and made the learning experience feel a lot less isolating.

### Cornwall‚Äôs Growing Tech Scene üåä

One of the best parts of the bootcamp has been having close contact with **Headforwards**, especially with Cornwall‚Äôs emerging tech community, it's a crucial part being on board with **Headforwards** as one of the biggest software companies around here, they've connections that can further take my tech career to the next level. Although Cornwall isn‚Äôt a **major tech hub** like **London** or **Bristol**, there‚Äôs a movement here, I can see there‚Äôs demand for fresh talent. Being part of this community feels **significant**. There‚Äôs a strong push to build a **sustainable tech ecosystem** in the region, and I‚Äôm excited to contribute to that **growth.** It‚Äôs also empowering to know that my skills could help shape the future of **Cornwall‚Äôs tech scene.**

### Advice for Aspiring Developers and Career Changers üìö

For anyone thinking about making a similar transition into tech with this bootcamp, my advice would be: don‚Äôt let a lack of experience hold you back. The bootcamp has taught me that **coding success** depends far more on **curiosity** and **persistence** than on previous technical knowledge. It‚Äôs about showing up every day, embracing challenges, and learning from mistakes.

This bootcamp is an **intense commitment**, but it‚Äôs also designed to make a real impact on students‚Äô **skills** and **confidence**. **Coding** is technical, but the most valuable lessons I‚Äôve learned are about **problem-solving**, **teamwork** and **adaptability**. If you‚Äôre ready to invest in yourself and work hard, there‚Äôs no reason you can‚Äôt succeed.

### Final Thoughts üåü

This journey has reshaped my **confidence**, my **skills**, and my perspective on what‚Äôs possible here in Cornwall. I‚Äôm really surprised by this opportunity. What started as a career pivot has turned into a path of continuous learning and growth. I used to see coding as something for others, as I‚Äôm not really good at math, but now it‚Äôs something that feels _like mine_. I can‚Äôt wait to keep building on everything I‚Äôve learned, and **I feel so grateful to be on this path.**
