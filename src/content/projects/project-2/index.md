WattsUp is designed to deliver energy rates for Octopus Energy users in a clear and user-friendly manner. Its primary goal is to help users save on their energy bills by providing insights into peak and off-peak periods for energy consumption, empowering them to make informed decisions about their usage. This project was developed during a three-day hackathon at Code Institute, following the completion of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript modules.

As part of the group Hackathon, I wrote the main script to fetch the REST API using Octopus Energy documentation!
